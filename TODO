TODO:
    - Read from file
    - Check this is still true: Î© segfaults (with a collossal stack of ~35k frames)
    - lhs/rhs reduction order can be changed to reduce wasted steps?
        For alpha only reduce when required: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Capture-avoiding_substitutions
        For beta reduce anything about to be substituted first
        Do this to such an extent that each line of :debug output is a useful
            transformation, use to make seperate :trace command. :trace would be
            invaluable if a bug is discovered in reduction.
